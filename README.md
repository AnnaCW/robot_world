Project Description:

### Robot World

Robot World is a Sinatra app created from scratch and styled with CSS. It is a directory of robots, each with a name, city, state, avatar, birthdate, date hired, and department. It includes CRUD functionality: we can see all robots, see one specific robot, edit/update a robot, create a robot, and delete a robot. It also includes a dashboard that shows statistical data: average robot age, a breakdown of how many robots were hired each year, and number of robots in each department/city/state.

To start the app:

```
$  shotgun
```
